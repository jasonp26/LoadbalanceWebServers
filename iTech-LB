# This is the Address to access the Webservers from the Load Balancer

# The address for the individual webservers

Each server is an Ubuntu 16 server.

Webserver 1:  35.176.139.106
Webserver 2:  35.176.120.69
Webserver 3:  35.176.64.127

By refreshing this link multiple times you will see that it cycles through the three different servers that are in my AWS
account

I was not able to figure out how to do the caching part of this exercise.

If i enabled the Cookie Stickiness feature on the AWS this would allow the load balancer to remain on just one server while
you refresh it and only if the server goes down completely will it then attempt to switch to another server
